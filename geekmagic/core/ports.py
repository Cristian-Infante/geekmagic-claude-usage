"""The ports: what the application needs from the outside world, as interfaces.

The application (geekmagic.application) is written against these and nothing else, so it knows no AI tool, no screen
hardware, no drawing library and no operating system. Each adapter (geekmagic.adapters) implements one of them; the
composition root (geekmagic.bootstrap) is the only place that picks which implementation to use.

Driven ports, implemented by adapters the application calls:
    Provider       an AI tool: read its usage, count its logs, see whether its agent is busy, sign in
    Display        the GeekMagic screen: store an image, show it, set the backlight
    DeviceLocator  finding that screen on the network
    Renderer       drawing the screens (readings in, a GIF out)
    Notifier       showing a desktop notification
    StateStore     remembering things between runs
    LockSensor     is the computer locked
    TerminalLauncher  open a terminal window that runs a command (a provider's sign-in)

Driving port, implemented by the adapter that calls the application:
    Ui             the tray icon: its title, its icon, its menu, its own notification
